# Beer API

The goal with this assignment was to include an existing API into my application. For this assigment I chose to use Brewdog's API. They are a beer company with a long list of beers so I chose to display a couple of facts about some beers that they brew.

## How It's Made
### Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- API's

## Lessons Learned
   I found this project quite hard. But I learned how to use Ajax gathering data from an API, and used jQuery to append elements while including the data pulled with Ajax to change the values.
